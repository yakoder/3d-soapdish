# 3d-soapdish
3D Design of a soap dish. Intended to be customizable.

## Current state
* Designed to fit my needs (to fit on a windowsill in the shower)
* Attempted to build-in some customizability:
    - Enable/Disable front drip-edge
    - Change dimensions
    - Enable/Disable grooves (untested)
    - Enable/Disable front wall (broken)

## Files
* soapdish.scad - OpenSCAD design file
* soapdish.stl - 3D print file, with front drip-edge
* images/ - Images of the design, to give an idea of what this looks like
